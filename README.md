About Me

I am a QA Engineer with 6 years of hands-on experience testing healthcare, imaging, and software platforms.  
My core strength is ensuring accuracy, stability, and user trust by validating systems end-to-end—from UI workflows to SQL backend data and API integrations.

I specialize in:
- Manual testing (80%) with automation exposure (20%)
- DICOM/PACS validation
- EMR workflow testing
- HIPAA-compliant mobile and web applications
- API and database synchronization testing

I work closely with developers, product teams, and clinical stakeholders to prevent defects before rollout, ensure seamless user experience, and protect patient data integrity.

My approach combines technical validation, critical thinking, collaboration, and a focus on outcomes that improve patient care and operational efficiency.

## 📂 Featured Healthcare QA Case Studies

Below are examples of end-to-end testing projects I’ve performed across clinical, imaging, and patient-facing systems:

- [DICOM / PACS Integration Testing](Test-Cases/DICOM_PACS_Integration_Test_Case.md)  
  Validated ultrasound image routing, metadata integrity, PACS ingestion, and radiologist viewer accessibility.

- [Mobile App Results Delivery Testing](Test-Cases/Mobile_App_Results_Testing.md)  
  Ensured secure PHI delivery, identity verification, API–SQL accuracy, and HIPAA compliance.

- [EMR SQL + API Sync Testing](Test-Cases/EMR_SQL_API_Sync_Testing.md)  
  Identified and helped resolve an API sync delay between SQL, API, and EMR UI to restore real-time clinical visibility.
