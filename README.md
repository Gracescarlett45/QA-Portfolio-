## 📂 Featured Healthcare QA Case Studies

Below are examples of end-to-end testing projects I’ve performed across clinical, imaging, and patient-facing systems:

- 📌 [DICOM / PACS Integration Testing](Test-Cases/DICOM_PACS_Integration_Test_Case.md)  
  Validated ultrasound image routing, metadata integrity, PACS ingestion, and radiologist viewer accessibility.

- 📌 [Mobile App Results Delivery Testing](Test-Cases/Mobile_App_Results_Testing.md)  
  Ensured secure PHI delivery, identity verification, API–SQL accuracy, and HIPAA compliance.

- 📌 [EMR SQL + API Sync Testing](Test-Cases/EMR_SQL_API_Sync_Testing.md)  
  Identified and helped resolve an API sync delay between SQL, API, and EMR UI to restore real-time clinical visibility.
