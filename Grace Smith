CASE STUDY: DICOM / PACS Integration Testing

Objective
Validate ultrasound image transmission from imaging device through DICOM routing into PACS, ensuring radiologists can view studies accurately.

---

Scope
- DICOM routing
- Study ingestion into PACS
- Metadata validation (patient + study attributes)
- Viewer access and display verification
- Negative/error handling scenarios

---

Preconditions
✔️ Ultrasound device configured with correct AE titles and routing  
✔️ DICOM nodes active and reachable  
✔️ PACS server operational  
✔️ Radiologist viewer access enabled with valid credentials

Test Steps & Expected Results

| Step | Action | Expected Result |
|------|--------|----------------|
| 1 | Send ultrasound study from device | Study transmits via DICOM successfully |
| 2 | Verify PACS worklist ingestion | Study appears in worklist with correct demographics |
| 3 | Launch radiologist viewer and open study | Images render fully with no corruption |
| 4 | Validate metadata in viewer | MRN, patient name, modality, study type are accurate |
| 5 | Transmit invalid or malformed study | PACS rejects, flags, or errors appropriately |
| 6 | Confirm radiologist access | Study is available and complete without missing frames |

---

Defects Identified
- Incorrect routing due to attribute/tag mismatch  
- Missing metadata field caused improper study classification  

---

Outcome
Testing ensured:
- Accurate study delivery
- Correct metadata display
- Seamless radiologist workflow  
- Early defect detection before production rollout  

All results and defects were logged and tracked in Jira for visibility, remediation, and retesting.
